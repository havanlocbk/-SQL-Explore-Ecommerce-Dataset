## üìå I. Introduction

This project explores the **Google Analytics eCommerce dataset** using SQL on **Google BigQuery**.
The goal is to analyze **website performance, customer behavior, and revenue trends**, providing insights that can inform data-driven business decisions.

---

## üìÇ II. Dataset

* **Source**: [Google Analytics Sample Dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/goog-public-data/google-analytics-sample)
* **Tables Used**: `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
* Covers **2017 eCommerce website sessions** including user traffic, transactions, and product activity.

---

## üîç III. Key Queries & Insights

1. **Traffic & Revenue Trends**

   * Calculated **visits, pageviews, transactions, and revenue** by month (Jan‚ÄìMar 2017).

2. **Bounce Rate Analysis**

   * Bounce rate by **traffic source** in July 2017.

3. **Revenue By Traffic Source*

   * Revenue contribution by **traffic source** (weekly & monthly).

4. **User Behavior**

   * Compared **pageviews of purchasers vs. non-purchasers** (June‚ÄìJuly 2017).

5. **Average Number of Transactions per Session**

   * Average number of transactions per user that made a purchase in July 2017.

6. **Average Spend per Session**

   * Calculated the average amount of money spent per session for purchasers in July 2017.

7. **Also-Bought Products Analysis**

   * Identified **products purchased together** (e.g., with *YouTube Men's Vintage Henley*).

8. **Cohort Funnel**

   * Conversion funnel from **Pageview ‚Üí Add to Cart ‚Üí Purchase** (Jan‚ÄìMar 2017).
   * Calculated **add-to-cart rate** and **purchase rate**.

## üõ† V. Tools & Skills

* **SQL**: Aggregations, filtering, cohort analysis, and funnel metrics.
* **Google BigQuery**: Querying large-scale datasets efficiently.
* **Data Analytics**: Extracting **KPIs** such as bounce rate, conversion rate, revenue attribution.

---

## üìä VI. Results

Key findings from the dataset:

* Steady growth in **visits and transactions** across Q1 2017 (+40% transactions).
* High **bounce rates** from several traffic sources, suggesting inefficient campaigns.
* Strong **revenue contribution** from **Direct** (\~97K) and **Google** (\~18.7K) traffic.
* Purchasers had far fewer pageviews than non-purchasers, showing more **focused browsing behavior**.
* Funnel analysis shows **drop-offs**: only \~8‚Äì13% of product views converted to purchases.
* Also-bought patterns highlight clear **cross-sell opportunities** (e.g., Google Sunglasses with YouTube apparel).
* Average spend per purchaser session in Jul 2017 was **\~43.86**.

---

## üöÄ VII. Next Steps

* Visualize KPIs and funnels using **Power BI / Tableau**.
* Build an **interactive dashboard** tracking revenue by source, bounce rate, and conversion funnel.
* Leverage **cross-sell recommendations** to boost average order value.
* Extend analysis with **Machine Learning** (e.g., customer segmentation, purchase prediction).
